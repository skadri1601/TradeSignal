# TradeSignal - Project Status

**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025
**Developer:** Saad Kadri (MS Computer Science @ UT Arlington)
**Project Type:** Portfolio Project - Insider Trading Intelligence Platform

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

TradeSignal is a real-time insider trading intelligence platform that tracks SEC Form 4 filings and provides insights on corporate insider transactions. Built with FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL, and React.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Backend Core (COMPLETED - Oct 26, 2025)

### What Was Built
- **FastAPI Backend** with async Python web framework
- **PostgreSQL Database** with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database Models**: Companies, Insiders, Trades with relationships
- **21 REST API Endpoints** for CRUD operations
- **Docker Compose** setup for PostgreSQL, FastAPI, React
- **Seed Data** for testing (6 companies, 7 insiders, 18 trades)

### API Endpoints Tested
- Companies: `/api/v1/companies/` (list, get, create, update, delete, stats)
- Insiders: `/api/v1/insiders/` (list, get, create, update, delete, trades, activity)
- Trades: `/api/v1/trades/` (list, get, create, update, delete, recent, stats, filter)

### Test Results
- ✅ All 21 endpoints working correctly
- ✅ Database queries optimized with proper relationships
- ✅ Pagination, filtering, sorting implemented
- ✅ Statistics and analytics endpoints functional

## ✅ Phase 2: SEC Scraper (COMPLETED - Oct 27, 2025)

### What Was Built
- **SEC EDGAR API Client** (`sec_client.py`)
  - Rate limiting: 10 requests/second
  - Proper User-Agent header required by SEC
  - ATOM feed parsing for Form 4 filings
  - Raw XML document fetching (not styled XHTML)

- **Form 4 XML Parser** (`form4_parser.py`)
  - lxml with XMLParser (preserves XML structure)
  - Extracts issuer information (CIK, name, ticker)
  - Extracts reporting owner details (name, title, relationships)
  - Parses non-derivative transactions (stock buys/sells)
  - Parses derivative transactions (options)
  - Calculates transaction details (shares, price, value)

- **Scraper Service** (`scraper_service.py`)
  - Orchestrates SEC API calls and database saves
  - Auto-creates companies if not in database
  - Auto-creates insiders with relationships
  - Saves all transactions with proper foreign keys
  - Handles duplicates gracefully

- **Scraper API Endpoints** (`scraper.py`)
  - `POST /api/v1/scraper/scrape` - Scrape by CIK or ticker
  - `GET /api/v1/scraper/scrape/{ticker}` - Quick scrape by ticker
  - `GET /api/v1/scraper/test` - Test SEC connectivity

### Test Results
✅ **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**
- 1 filing processed
- 9 trades created
- Insider: Kevan Parekh (Senior Vice President, CFO)
- Transactions: Options exercise (16,457 shares) + tax withholding sell (8,062 shares @ $249.34 = $2M) + multiple sells

✅ **Tesla Inc. (TSLA)**
- 2 filings processed
- 26 trades created
- Insider: Elon Musk (CEO, Director, 10% Owner)
- Transactions: $388M in stock purchases (985,277 shares @ ~$394)

### Issues Resolved
1. ✅ Import path error: `app.core.config` → `app.config`
2. ✅ DNS resolution failure: Added Google DNS to docker-compose.yml
3. ✅ Date filter bug: Removed date filtering due to future system clock
4. ✅ Fetching styled XHTML instead of raw XML: Fixed regex pattern
5. ✅ XML parsing returning empty data: Switched from HTMLParser to XMLParser

### Files Created
```

├── sec_client.py         # SEC EDGAR API client
├── form4_parser.py       # Form 4 XML parser
└── scraper_service.py    # Scraper orchestration
