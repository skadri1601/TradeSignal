## Data Sources & Accuracy

### Where does TradeSignal get its data?

- **SEC Form 4 Filings:** Directly from SEC EDGAR database
- **Congressional Trades:** Via Finnhub API (Beta, requires API key)
- **Company Data:** SEC filings and public sources
- **Market Data:** Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, CoinGecko, FRED API
- **AI Insights:** Google Gemini or OpenAI (Beta, requires API key)

### How fresh is the data?

- **SEC Form 4 Filings:** Updated every 6 hours via automated scraper
- **Congressional Trades:** Depends on Finnhub API (may have 1-7 day delays)
- **Stock Prices:** Real-time when available, may fall back to delayed data
- **AI Insights:** Cached for 24 hours to optimize performance

### Is the data accurate?

We source data from official SEC filings and reputable APIs. However, data may contain errors from source systems, and we cannot guarantee 100% accuracy. Always verify critical information from official sources.

### Why are some features marked as Beta or Experimental?

- **Beta features** are functional but may require API keys or have limitations
- **Experimental features** may be intermittent or have limited reliability
- See [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES_ALPHA_v1.0.0.md) for complete status

5. Save

### How many alerts can I have?

### How quickly do alerts trigger?

Alerts typically trigger within 5 minutes of trade detection. This may vary based on data source freshness.

**Note:** This is a backend configuration. Contact support if you need help setting this up.

Congressional trades track stock transactions by members of the U.S. Congress, as required by the STOCK Act.
