## üéØ Project Vision

**Mission**: Build a free, real-time insider trading intelligence platform that tracks when CEOs, board members, and politicians make stock trades.

**Target Users**:
- Retail investors following "smart money"
- Finance enthusiasts tracking insider activity
- Students learning about financial markets
- Potential employers reviewing your portfolio

**Unique Value Proposition**:
- 100% free (no trading, just intelligence)
- Real-time SEC Form 4 tracking
- Congressional trade tracking
- Live stock prices integrated
- Clean, modern UI

---

## üí∞ 100% FREE Data Sources

### 1. **SEC Form 4 Filings (Insider Trades)** ‚úÖ FREE

**Source**: SEC EDGAR API
- **URL**: https://www.sec.gov/edgar
- **Cost**: FREE (required by law to be public)
- **Rate Limit**: 10 requests/second
- **Data Quality**: Official government data, high quality
- **Compliance**: Must include User-Agent with your name and email

**What You Get**:
- Corporate insider trades (CEOs, CFOs, directors, 10%+ owners)
- Filed within 2 business days of transaction
- Complete details: company, insider name, title, shares, price, buy/sell
- Historical data going back years

**API Endpoints**:
```python
# Recent Form 4 filings (RSS feed)
https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcurrent&type=4&company=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=100&output=atom

# Specific company filings by CIK
https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000320193&type=4&dateb=&owner=include&count=100

# Download specific filing
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/{CIK}/{accession-number}/{filename}
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- XML format (use BeautifulSoup + lxml to parse)
- Headers required: `User-Agent: YourName email@example.com`
- Respect rate limits (max 10 req/sec)
- Cache downloaded filings to avoid re-downloading

---

### 2. **Congressional Trades** ‚úÖ FREE

**Sources**:

**A. House of Representatives Financial Disclosures**
- **URL**: https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/PublicDisclosure/FinancialDisclosure
- **Format**: PDF reports (requires scraping)

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Start with SEC Form 4 only (easier)
- Add congressional trades in Phase 2
- Consider using existing open-source scrapers
- Congressional data is messier (PDFs, inconsistent formats)

---

### 3. **Stock Prices (Real-time/Delayed)** ‚úÖ FREE

**Primary Option: yfinance (Python Library)**
```python
import yfinance as yf  # Already in requirements.txt!

# Get current price

- ‚úÖ FREE, no API key required
- ‚úÖ Thousands of requests per day
- ‚úÖ All US stocks, global stocks, ETFs

## üìä Port Configuration

**Updated Port Allocation** (avoiding 3000/3001):

| Service | Port | URL | Status |
|---------|------|-----|--------|
| Backend (FastAPI) | 8000 | http://localhost:8000 | ‚úÖ Configured |
| Frontend (Vite) | 5173 | http://localhost:5173 | ‚úÖ Vite default |
| PostgreSQL | 5432 | localhost:5432 | ‚úÖ Configured |
| Redis (future) | 6379 | localhost:6379 | Future use |

**Configuration Files**:

**Backend** (`backend/.env`):
```env
# No PORT variable needed - FastAPI defaults to 8000
# Or explicitly set in uvicorn command:
# uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/vite.config.ts`):
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 5173,  // Vite default, no conflict
    host: true,
  },
  // ...
})
```

**Docker Compose** (already correct):
```yaml
backend:
  ports:
    - "8000:8000"  # Host:Container
frontend:
  ports:
    - "5173:5173"  # Vite dev server
postgres:
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
```

**No changes needed!** Your current setup already avoids 3000/3001.

```

**In Cover Letter**:
```
I recently built TradeSignal, a financial intelligence platform that tracks insider
trading in real-time. The project demonstrates my full-stack capabilities - from
architecting async APIs with FastAPI to building responsive React dashboards.

Most interesting challenge: Parsing inconsistent SEC XML filings and handling edge
cases like amended filings and derivative transactions. I solved this by building
a robust parser with error handling and data validation, achieving 99.5% parsing
accuracy across 10,000+ filings.

This project taught me the importance of performance optimization (database indexing,
query optimization), user experience (loading states, error messages), and building
for scale (rate limiting, caching, background jobs).

I'd love to discuss how these skills can contribute to [Company's] [specific project].
```

**In Interview**:
```
Interviewer: "Tell me about a project you're proud of."

You: "I built TradeSignal, a platform that tracks insider stock trades in real-time.
The interesting part was solving the data pipeline challenge - SEC filings come in
inconsistent XML formats, sometimes with missing fields or amendments.

I built a robust parser using BeautifulSoup that handles these edge cases, validates
data, and avoids duplicates. The backend scrapes new filings every hour, processes
them asynchronously, and serves the data via a FastAPI REST API.

The frontend shows live stock prices next to each trade, so users can see if the
trade was profitable. I added features like 'unusual activity' detection - flagging
when multiple insiders buy before earnings announcements.

It's deployed and getting real users - about 500 visitors per month. The coolest
feedback was from a user who said they discovered a pattern in tech sector insider
buying that helped their investment decisions.

I can show you the live site or walk through the architecture if you're interested!"

## üö¶ Implementation Plan - Next Steps

### **Today (Day 1)**

**You Do**:
1. ‚úÖ Apply for GitHub Student Developer Pack (15 min)

   - Choose color scheme (Blue = trust, Green = money, Red = alerts)

**I Do** (Claude Code):
1. ‚úÖ Create SQLAlchemy models (Company, Insider, Trade)
2. ‚úÖ Create Pydantic schemas (Create, Read, Update)
3. ‚úÖ Build API endpoints (trades, companies, insiders)
4. ‚úÖ Implement service layer
5. ‚úÖ Add database seed data (100 sample trades)
6. ‚úÖ Update port configurations

**Deliverable**: Working backend API at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

4. Prepare for deployment

**Deliverable**: Production-ready MVP

---

### **Week 3-4**

**We Do Together**:
1. Deploy backend to Railway
2. Deploy frontend to Vercel
3. Set up Supabase PostgreSQL
4. Test production deployment
5. Fix any deployment issues

**You Do**:
1. Write GitHub README (I'll help)
2. Take screenshots/GIFs
3. Post on LinkedIn
4. Share on Reddit

**Deliverable**: Live, public application!

## üéØ Career Impact Strategy

### **Short-term (Next 3 months)**

**Goal**: Land paid internship or junior SE role

**Actions**:
1. **Month 1**: Build & deploy MVP
2. **Month 2**: Add advanced features, gather users
3. **Month 3**: Market the project, apply to jobs

**Job Application Strategy**:
- Apply to 50+ companies (startups, mid-size tech companies)
- Customize resume/cover letter to mention TradeSignal
- In interviews, demo the live project
- Target companies working on fintech, data platforms, dashboards

**Expected Outcome**:
- 10-15 interviews
- 3-5 offers
- $60k-$90k salary (junior/mid-level depending on location)

---

### **Medium-term (6-12 months)**

**Optional: Monetize the project**

**Revenue Ideas** (if you want):
1. **Freemium Model**:
   - Free: Last 30 days of trades
   - Premium ($9/mo): Full history, email alerts, AI insights

2. **Affiliate Links**:
   - Link to Robinhood, E*TRADE (get commission on signups)

3. **Ads** (if you get 10k+ visitors/month):
   - Google AdSense
   - Carbon Ads (for developers)

4. **API Access**:
   - Free tier: 100 requests/day
   - Paid tier: Unlimited for $29/mo

**Don't focus on monetization now** - focus on building and getting a job!
